# Large-Scale Soil Organic Carbon Estimation via a Multisource Data Fusion Approach ([paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/5/771))

Implementation of a methodological framework for predicting Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) using laboratory spectral data from a handheld Near-Infrared spectrometer combined with open geospatial covariates derived from remote sensing sources. The repository includes code for data preprocessing, spectral feature extraction using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and hybrid modeling with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for SOC prediction. The developed hybrid CNN-XGBoost model significantly enhances predictive performance, achieving high accuracy (RÂ² of 0.72, RMSE of 0.31 log-SOC, and RPIQ of 2.17), outperforming traditional machine learning methods. Additionally, interpretability techniques are employed to elucidate the contributions of climatic factors, topographical features, and spectral information, highlighting the complex environmental interactions driving SOC variability.
